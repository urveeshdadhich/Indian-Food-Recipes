# odin-recipes
Project for www.theodinproject.com (Foundations/HTML Foundations)

This project is for the HTML Foundations for the Foundations course. The website will have an index page which has links to pages which show different recipes. I have added some more (although basic) features to it, such as a back button on the recipe pages, to make the website easy to read and navigate. These feature have also let me get more practice using HTML.

## Things I have learnt and shown in this project:
- File structuring for website files
- Practice with learning how and when to commit
- What a HTML boilerplate is and how to write one
- How to use different sized headings in HTML -- `<h1> - <h6>`
- How to create lists in HTML -- `<ul> - <ol> - <li>`
- How to add links to other pages using HTML -- `<a>`
- How to add images to pages using HTMl -- `<img>`
- How to add paragraphs using HTML -- `<p>`
- How to use comments in HTML -- `<!-- comment -->`
- How to write fractions in HTML -- `&frac12 = Â½`
- How to use different attributes for different HTML elements
